# Udacity Data Engineering Capstone Project
Repository for Udacity Data Engineering capstone project.

## Introduction
The capstone project of Udacity's [Data Engineering](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) requires students to combine knowledge learned in the program to build a front to end solution covering the essential elements in data engineering.

This project gathers three data sets:
* Britain's national rail [historic service performance (HSP)](https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php/HSP)
* European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) [ERA5 hourly data](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview)
* ECMWF [open data](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/open-data)

The data extract, transform and load (ETL) pipeline is implemented using Apache [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/). Data is stored on an instance of [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/).
